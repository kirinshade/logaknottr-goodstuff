## What is this?
  This is a github repository for all the aliases compiled in the [Logaknottr Goodstuff](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/6992a1b8f91c78017f9cb209/edit) collection using the Avrae discord bot

### What's in each folder?
* "Aliases" contains .alias files and their .md help text
* "Snippets" contains .snippet files and their .md help text
* "Gvars" contains .gvar files and an explanatory .md text

### Why does this exist?
Rather than further contribute to the bloat of custom server aliases on Logaknottr, I decided to compile everything into a collection. The tradeoff to this is that my code is no longer open source. So, I wrote this!
