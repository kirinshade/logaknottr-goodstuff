"Nonlethal" snippet, identical to the one in [Brinjal's Shortcuts and Utilities](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/5f89e077bbee1bca82ad3778).

The functionality of this is limited, and only provides flavor text in the attack embed. Importantly, __it does not prevent the combatant being removed from init__, nor does it grant any special init effects to specify the target is still alive.

Because of these limitations, it is recommended you use `!nonlethal` from [Riptide's Shortcuts](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/60069282052554a14d397617) instead.
