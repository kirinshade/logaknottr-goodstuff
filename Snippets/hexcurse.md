"Hexblade's Curse" - snippet that accommodates the increased critical range and extra necrotic damage. Technically this already exists in [Riptide's Warlock Compendium](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/5fbf39a10260807c831fe1f1), but it is stored under a different name, minimizing conflicts.

This version is not integrated with `!level`, nor does it enforce the prerequisite of being a warlock
